This is to connect fresh new linux server to ansible over ssh connection

1) first step is to connect from control machine to new server over simple ssh like this 
do this from CONTROL ANSIBLE SERVER 
for example :    ssh ubuntu@192.168.1.33
then              type yes for accepting the public key 
then              enter ubuntu or password

2) now you are inside ubuntu machine you need to enable root ssh password authentication and also set password for rooot user

sudo passwd root  # changing/ setting password for root

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

edit line PermitRootLogin without-password 
to 
PermitRootLogin without-password yes 

save file by control x

3) sudo service ssh restart

4) exit # to control server again

now run my script beside this readme

5) chmod 777 setup-new.sh
6) ./setup-new.sh 
now proceed with script with root user not any other and use the password you set in step 2
